Ready to install Visual Studio? Good! Let's do it. Before you start though, you'll need to make sure that your computer is running the latest version of Windows 10. Then, simply follow a link and the installation will be performed automatically.

## Make sure Windows 10 is up-to-date

1. Go to **Settings**.
1. Select **Update & Security**.

1. Let any updates install.

## Go to the installation script page on GitHub

1. Using Microsoft Edge, go to [this page on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts).

Just in case you're curious, the script will install the following tools:

* Visual Studio 2017 Community edition
