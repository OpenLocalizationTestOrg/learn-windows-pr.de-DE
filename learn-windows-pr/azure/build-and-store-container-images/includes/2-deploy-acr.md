## Create an Azure container registry

We'll be working in a free sandbox, so there's no need to create your own Resource Group. Create an Azure container registry with the `az acr create` command. The container registry name must be unique within Azure and contain between 5 and 50 alphanumeric characters.

In this example, a premium registry SKU is deployed. The premium SKU is required for geo-replication. 

To begin, we'll define an environment variable in the Cloud Shell called **ACR_NAME**  to hold the name we want to give our new container registry.

1. Run the following command to define a variable called ACR_NAME.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before running the command, replace  `<registry-name>` with the unique name you want to give your new container registry. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 **alphanumeric** characters. For more information on naming, see [Naming conventions for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions?azure-portal=true).

    ```azurecli
    ACR_NAME=<registry-name>
    ```
1. Enter the following command into the cloud shell editor to create our new container registry.

    ```azurecli
    az acr create --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> --name $ACR_NAME --sku Premium
    ```

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

    The following snippet is an example response from the `az acr create` command. In this example, the registry name was *myACR*. Note that the loginServer value below is the registry name in lowercase, by default.  
    
    ```output
    {
      "adminUserEnabled": false,
      "creationDate": "2018-08-15T19:19:07.042178+00:00",
      "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/myACR0007",
      "location": "eastus",
      "loginServer": "myacr.azurecr.io",
      "name": "myACR",
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
      "sku": {
        "name": "Premium",
        "tier": "Premium"
      },
      "status": null,
      "storageAccount": null,
      "tags": {},
      "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries"
    }
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Commands in the rest of this module will use the **ACR_NAME** variable value. 

In this unit, you created an Azure Container Registry using the Azure CLI. We'll use that new container registry in the next unit when we build container images.
