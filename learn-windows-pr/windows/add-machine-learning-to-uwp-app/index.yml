title: Add a machine learning model to a UWP app so that it can run offline on a Windows device
summary: Experience the benefits of local client-side evaluation with the Intelligent Edge by downloading a pre-trained image classification model and adding it to a UWP app. Windows Machine Learning (ML) enables models to run evaluations offline on any Windows 10 device.

  In this module, you will:
  - Compare using a machine learning model locally with Windows ML to a cloud-based system
  - Set up a simple UWP app with C#
  - Add a pre-trained machine learning model to your app
  - Load the model, bind the inputs and outputs, and use it to evaluate input
  - Test the model by drawing digits into a Windows Ink Canvas to see whether the model can recognize what number we've drawn
prerequisites: |
 - A basic understanding of UWP app development with C#
