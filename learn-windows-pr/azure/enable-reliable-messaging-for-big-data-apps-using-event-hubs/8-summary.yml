  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "Applications that publish messages to Azure Event Hub very frequently will get the best performance using Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) because it establishes a persistent socket."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Publishers can use either HTTPS or AMQP. AMQP opens a socket and can send multiple messages over that socket."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Publishers can use either HTTPS or AMQP. HTTP is not ideal for frequent publishing because it establishes a new connection for each publication."
 
  - content: "By default, how many partitions will a new Event Hub have?"
    choices:
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Hubs default to 4 partitions. Partitions are the buckets within an Event Hub. Each publication will go into only one partition. Each consumer group may read from one or more than one partition."
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Hubs default to 4 partitions. Partitions are the buckets within an Event Hub. Each publication will go into only one partition. Each consumer group may read from one or more than one partition."
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Hubs default to 4 partitions. Partitions are the buckets within an Event Hub. Each publication will go into only one partition. Each consumer group may read from one or more than one partition."
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Event Hubs default to 4 partitions. Partitions are the buckets within an Event Hub. Each publication will go into only one partition. Each consumer group may read from one or more than one partition."
 
  - content: "If an Event Hub goes offline before a consumer group can process the events it holds, those events will be lost."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Events are persistent. Each consumer group has its own cursor maintaining its position within the partition. The consumer groups can resume processing at their cursor position when the Event Hub is again available."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Events are persistent. Each consumer group has its own cursor maintaining its position within the partition. The consumer groups can resume processing at their cursor position when the Event Hub is again available."
