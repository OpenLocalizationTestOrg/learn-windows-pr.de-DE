You've successfully created a cross-platform mobile app using Xamarin and an Azure function with a Twilio binding.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms app that uses Xamarin.Essentials.
- Create a cross-platform UI using XAML with application logic in a ViewModel, as well as bind properties in a ViewModel to the UI.
- Detect the user's location.
- Create an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger and run it locally.
- Call an Azure Function from a mobile app, passing data as JSON.
- Bind an Azure Function to Twilio to send an SMS message.
- Publish an Azure Function to Azure.

## Clean up

In this module, we used a VM lab and were provided an Azure account. You don't need to clean up the resources - they'll be automatically cleaned up at the end of the module.
