The Eclipse integrated development environment is a popular tool for Java development. It's also a great choice for connecting your Java applications to Azure; the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse provides templates and features to streamline Azure integration with your Java applications.

## Eclipse

Eclipse is the most widely used Java IDE. It is also a versatile development environment, featuring an extensible plugin architecture that can be used to support languages other than Java. While most Eclipse users are Java developers, Eclipse can also be used to build applications with C++, Python, C, and Ruby. 

Eclipse is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation process uses the Eclipse installer on all platforms, varying only in installation procedures between the platforms.

Installing Eclipse for Java or Java EE on any platform is straightforward. The installer will prompt you to choose the packages to install depending on the target language and frameworks.

## Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

The Azure Toolkit for Eclipse provides templates and functionality that you can use to easily create, develop, test, and deploy cloud applications to Azure from Eclipse. The Azure Toolkit is open source, actively developed, and hosted in GitHub. 

The toolkit includes integration templates for Docker containers, HDInsights, Azure documentation, Azure Cache for Redis, storage account operations, and virtual machine management.

The Azure Toolkit is installed through the Eclipse IDE itself; it's the same procedure on all the supported operating systems. The toolkit is available from the **Eclipse Marketplace**.
