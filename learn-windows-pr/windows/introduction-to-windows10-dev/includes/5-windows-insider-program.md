# Staying ahead of the curve

The Windows Insider Program is a free service that provides prerelease access to the latest builds of Windows 10 and development SDKs. It allows you to test upcoming Windows 10 features and APIs before they're released to the public and can help keep you up to date with the latest in Windows development.

## Join the Windows Insider Program

To join the Windows Insider Program, you need a Microsoft account.

Once you have a Microsoft account, you must register for the program. Within the **Settings** app, navigate to **Update & Security** and select **Windows Insider Program**. Then, select **Get Started**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have administrator rights to your computer to see the **Windows Insider Program** tab, and to install the prerelease features it provides.

If you have already registered for the Windows Insider Program, you will still need to sign in to the registered Microsoft account to receive prerelease builds of Windows on a new computer.

## Install preview builds

Once your registration and signup are complete, you will be prompted to choose the prerelease content and release pace that fits your needs. This can be changed later if your requirements change.

We recommend that developers select **Active development of Windows** as their content type.

If you are not familiar with working on prerelease builds, we recommend that you choose **Windows Insider Slow** as the pace. This will ensure access to prerelease features with minimal disruption to your computer.

Once you have chosen your content type and pace, read and accept the privacy statement and the program agreement. Microsoft collects information from computers running the Windows Insider Program, to identify issues and to improve the user experience of prerelease builds of Windows before they are released to the general public.
