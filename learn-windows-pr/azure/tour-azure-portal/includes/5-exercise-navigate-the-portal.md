The Azure Portal has a lot of features and services available; let's look at some of the more common areas you'll tend to use. First, take a moment to hover your mouse pointer over each of the icons in the top menu bar for a few seconds each. You should see a tooltip label pop up for each one. This is the name of the menu item. You will use these icons later.
