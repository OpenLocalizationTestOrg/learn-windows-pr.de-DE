## Cleanup
The sandbox will clean up your resources automatically for you when you are finished with this module. However, when you're working in your own subscription you'll likely want to remove the resources you created after you've completed the exercises.

Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources one by one, or delete the resource group to remove the entire set.
