 Your PIO wants to set up a virtual machine to serve as a web resource for local media outlets. It is imperative that this virtual machine is as protected as it can be to prevent unauthorized access. As part of your security profile, you want to implement Update Management on this VM so that you can ensure that it is always up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Onboard Update Manager to the VM

Here you'll enable Update Manager on the virtual machine you just created.

1. In the left pane, click **Virtual machines**.
2. In the **Virtual machines** pane, select the virtual machine from the list. In this example, select **MediaWebServer**.
3. In the MediaWebServer pane, scroll down the list to **Operations**, and then click **Update management**.
4. In the **Update Management** pane, ensure that the **Enable for this VM** radio button is selected. Note that a default **Log Analytics workspace** and **Automation account** will be created. Accept the remaining defaults, and then click **Enable**.
5. In the upper left corner click the Notification bell and wait for deployment to finish.
6. When Update Management deployment has completed, the Update Management menu will appear as shown below.
