An Azure function won't do work until something explicitly tells it to execute. In this module, we explored the timer, HTTP, and blob triggers.

Timer triggers are great when you need to execute a function at a consistent time. HTTP triggers allow you to execute logic when you receive data from an outside source. Blob triggers allow you to respond to data that's stored or updated in the cloud.
