quiz:
    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: How did the first app interact with Azure Cognitive Services?
      choices:
      - content: The app embedded a Bing-enabled searchbar inside its UI.
        explanation: While the app did use Bing, it didn't embed a searchbar or a web view within its simple UI.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The app sent text to Azure machine learning, and retrieved an image associated with that text.
        explanation: Incorrect. Machine learning wasn't directly used in this app.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The first app didn't interact with Azure Cognitive Services.
        explanation: Incorrect. This app uses Bing features which are part of the Azure Cognitive Services features.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The app sent text to Bing Image Search and retrieved a response containing an image's URL.
        explanation: Correct! This is a great example of using an API to let your API process user input.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What is JSON, and how is it used?
      choices:
      - content: JSON is an encrypted format for sharing data. Specific libraries are needed to read or write JSON files.
        explanation: JSON isn't encrypted, and libraries aren't necessary to work with it (though they make it a lot easier!)
        isCorrect: false
      - content: JSON is a text-based format for sharing data between apps and services. Libraries can make working with JSON easier.
        explanation: Correct! In this module, we recieved a JSON result from external APIs, and used a library to work with them.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: JSON is an image encoding format that can include metadata.
        explanation: JSON is a text format. In this module, the JSON results we worked with contained a URL link to an image, but didn't encode the image itself.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: In the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" app, which task was made easier by modern features in UWP?
      choices:
      - content: Async operations.
        explanation: The basic async operation structure is the same in all three versions of the app.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Saving and loading settings.
        explanation: Correct! APIs available in UWP allow for settings to be loaded and saved without creating an init file.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: UI Design.
        explanation: While UWP does provide modern UI features, in this app, there was no significant difference between the UI of the UWP and WPF versions.
        isCorrect: false
