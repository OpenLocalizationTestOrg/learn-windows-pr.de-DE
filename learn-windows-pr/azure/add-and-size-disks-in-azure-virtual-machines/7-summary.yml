  questions:

  - content: "Virtual hard drive files (VHDs) are stored in which of the following types of blobs in Azure Storage?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Block Blobs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VHDs are backed by page blobs in Azure Storage. Page blobs are appropriate because they are a collection of 512-byte pages optimized for random read and write. Neither Block blobs nor Append blobs are optimized for the random read and write operations common with VHDs."
    - content: "Append Blobs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VHDs are backed by page blobs in Azure Storage. Page blobs are appropriate because they are a collection of 512-byte pages optimized for random read and write. Neither Block blobs nor Append blobs are optimized for the random read and write operations common with VHDs."
    - content: "Page Blobs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "VHDs are backed by page blobs in Azure Storage. Page blobs are appropriate because they are a collection of 512-byte pages optimized for random read and write. Neither Block blobs nor Append blobs are optimized for the random read and write operations common with VHDs."

  - content: "Which of the following data-replication strategies is the only option supported by a premium storage account?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A premium storage account supports only locally redundant storage as the replication option. Locally redundant storage keeps three copies of the data within a single region. For regional disaster recovery, you must back up your VM disks in a different region by using Azure Backup. You also must use a geo-redundant storage (GRS) account as the backup vault."
    - content: "Locally redundant storage (LRS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A premium storage account supports only locally redundant storage as the replication option. Locally redundant storage keeps three copies of the data within a single region. For regional disaster recovery, you must back up your VM disks in a different region by using Azure Backup. You also must use a geo-redundant storage (GRS) account as the backup vault."
    - content: "Geo-redundant storage (GRS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A premium storage account supports only locally redundant storage as the replication option. Locally redundant storage keeps three copies of the data within a single region. For regional disaster recovery, you must back up your VM disks in a different region by using Azure Backup. You also must use a geo-redundant storage (GRS) account as the backup vault."
    - content: "Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A premium storage account supports only locally redundant storage as the replication option. Locally redundant storage keeps three copies of the data within a single region. For regional disaster recovery, you must back up your VM disks in a different region by using Azure Backup. You also must use a geo-redundant storage (GRS) account as the backup vault."

  - content: "Which of the following disk types is only available for managed disks?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Standard solid-state drives (SSDs)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Choosing managed disks gives you the option of using standard SSDs. This disk type is between standard HDDs and premium SSDs from a performance and cost perspective."
    - content: "Standard hard disk drives (HDDs)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Choosing managed disks gives you the option of using standard SSDs. This disk type is between standard HDDs and premium SSDs from a performance and cost perspective."
    - content: "Premium solid-state drives (SSDs)"
      isCorrect: false
